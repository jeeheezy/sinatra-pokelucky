Welcome to PokeLucky! 
If you'd like to put your Pokemon luck to the test, this is the place for you! If you ever felt you were incredibly lucky in the Safari Zone or have caught a legendary with a pokeball, this is the place to put that to the test!
PokeLucky is a simulator to catch the 151 Gen 1 Pokemon with base capture rate, using just a pokeball, and assuming that all spawned Pokemon are level 100. 
Clicking on explore will spawn either a pokeball for you to pick up or spawn a Pokemon. If you have a pokeball and encounter a Pokemon, you can try to catch it. If you fail to catch the pokemon, it may stay but it may flee! If you do catch it, you are able to add the Pokemon to your party. However, there's a party limit of 6 Pokemon so if you want to add a newly caught Pokemon after having a full party, you'll need to release one of your current party members! Releasing a caught Pokemon will refund you the pokeball they were kept in. 
Your progress is tracked through cookies, but if you at any point would like to restart your adventure from scratch, simply click on the "Reset progress" button on the main menu.
Give it a go and see which Pokemons you are able to catch and keep!
